/** 
 * Design a solution to calculate what to pay for a set of phone calls. The function must receive an array of objects that will contain 
 * the identifier, type and duration attributes. For the type attribute, the only valid values are: National, International and Local
 * 
 * The criteria for calculating the cost of each call is as follows:
 * 
 * International: first 3 minutes $ 7.56 -> $ 3.03 for each additional minute
 * National: first 3 minutes $ 1.20 -> $ 0.48 per additional minute
 * Local: $ 0.2 per minute.
 * 
 * The function must return the total calls, the details of each call (the detail received + the cost of the call) and the total to pay 
 * taking into account all calls
 * 
 * @param {Call[]} calls - Call's information to be processed
 * 
 * @returns {CallsResponse}  - Processed information
